# Zilla-Vikas-Munch-Admin-Panel
### Description
Here DM and Goverement officers can see the current progress of the Zilla Vikas Munch Portal. The special login given to him for this.
 It's divided into the four sections:
 * Submit Problem
 * Pending Problems
 * Student Problems
 * Add a Problem<br/>
 In this portal, I have tried to build a bridge between the government and the general public. Where people can reach their government by writing their problems on the portal. And government and engineering students can solve these problems. The progress of problems can be seen in Monthly, State Wise, District wise. DM will also be able to see Progress. Efforts have been made to make this website creative so that more people can join it.
